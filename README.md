# ft_printf


```c
int    i;
char   *s;

i = 42;
s = "Hi";

ft_printf("%{BLUE}.4s %{RED}*.1d", s, 7, i);
```

### About

A 42 project dedicated to reimplement the famous libc function printf ([Project subject](resources/ft_printf.en.pdf))

At 42 all C projects must be developed like the [norme](resources/norme.en.pdf) want to.



### Performance

I don't use dynamic heap memory allocation at all, i use a buffer on the stack instead to minimize the number of system calls when allocating and printing. The buffer size can be updated, its size is defined in `/includes/ft_printf.h`.

Around 20 percent faster than the original version of printf without compiler optimization flags. (tested with clang on osx)

Some bonusÂ flags added like color flags, float print engine, boolean print, memory print..

Otherwise libc functions like strlen, memcpy.. were optimized for faster processing. (see `/srcs/pf_mini_libft`)
